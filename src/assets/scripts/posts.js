    value : 'My prayer goals for the next few weeks are: 1. That God would help me to create new habits for prayer and Bible reading. I would like to transform into being more committed and consistent but have always been unsuccessful setting this goal in the past. I need God to help me transform my habits in this way. 2. That God would help me be more diligent in my schoolwork. I know that he wants me to do my best in the things he has given me to do, and I am not giving my best efforts in some areas. I feel convicted about this. 3. That God would help me to remember him as I am living my life throughout the week. It is really easy for me to just forget about him, but I want to be able to see how he is always with me and guiding me in small and large things.',
